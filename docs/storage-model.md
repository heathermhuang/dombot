# Storage model

Status: implemented except where noted: storage conventions (#102), and the
domain history on `domain-events` (#106): purchases and sales as events, sync
events and alerts, Owned / Archive, the Hidden folder, the Activity page and
the bell. Not yet: manual domains (#108), the lookup-recorded automatic drop
(waits on the central RDAP module, #105), and `renewed` events (#107).

A naming and keying standard for everything DomBot persists, a domain event
history that replaces the separate purchase and portfolio-change stores
(#99, #100), and the one-time migration that moves existing installs onto it.

## Why

- **Names don't say what's inside.** `cache-portfolio` and a future `domains`
  both sound like "the domains." `portfolio-changes` and `cache-portfolio` put
  the same word in different positions. The prefix `cache-` is doing double
  duty as a behavior flag.
- **Behavior lives in hand-kept lists.** `CACHE_NAMESPACES` (Clear cache) and
  `NEVER_EXPORTED` (data bundle) have to be remembered whenever a namespace is
  added.
- **Per-domain data is keyed three different ways.** Folder assignments and
  price overrides use `${accountId ?? registrar}:${domain}`, so they're lost
  when a name moves between accounts. Purchases (#99) use the bare name. None
  of them canonicalize IDNs.
- **History can't hold repeats.** #99 stores one purchase per name, so a name
  you drop and later buy back overwrites its first purchase. #100 stores every
  change in one array under one key, so each change rewrites the whole history.

## Two kinds of domain data

|                   | Registrar-reported                           | Yours                                                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Examples          | the account's name list, expiry, nameservers | notes, purchases, sales, folders, price overrides, manually added names |
| Keyed by          | account                                      | domain name                                                             |
| Can be re-fetched | yes                                          | no                                                                      |
| Authority         | the registrar                                | you                                                                     |
| Namespace prefix  | `registrar-`                                 | `domain-`, `manual-domains`                                             |

The Domains page merges the two: the registrar's list plus manual domains,
annotated with your notes, folders, prices, and history.

## Naming

Kebab-case: `<subject>-<plural noun>`. Names describe the data, not how it's
treated. Behavior is declared where the namespace is created:

```ts
new Namespace('registrar-domains', { cache: true }); // Clear cache wipes it
new Namespace('remote-sync', { local: true }); // never exported
new Namespace('domain-events'); // default: kept, exported
```

`clearAll` and `exportNamespaces` read those flags from the registry, which
retires `CACHE_NAMESPACES` and `NEVER_EXPORTED`. Encryption stays an explicit
set passed to `EncryptedDocStore`.

Clear cache now also wipes `registrar-tld-rates`; the next sync refetches it.
`rdap-lookups` is flagged cache too, so Clear cache wipes it as well (today
#100 keeps it).

## Keys

- **Anything about a name, wherever it's held:** `toAscii(name)` from
  `src/shared/domain-name.ts` — lowercased, protocol and outer dots stripped,
  punycode. `Münich.DE`, `https://münich.de/`, and `xn--mnich-kva.de` are one
  key. `toUnicode` is for display only.
- **Anything about one account's copy of a name** (registrar cache only):
  `${accountId}:${toAscii(name)}`.
- The `${accountId ?? registrar}:` fallback goes away in the migration.

Folders and price overrides are keyed by name, so they follow a domain when it
moves between accounts. A name held by two accounts at once (mid-transfer)
shares one folder and one price.

## Domain events

One document per event in `domain-events`, keyed by a time-sortable id, so a
new event writes one small row and never rewrites the history.

Event types and sources are const maps in `src/shared/domain-events.ts`, in
the same style as `IpcChannels`, so code reads `DomainEventType.Removed`
rather than a bare string. The stored value is the lowercase string, which
never changes once written; renaming a constant is free, renaming a value
needs a migration.

```ts
export const DomainEventType = {
  // Something you did.
  Registered: 'registered', // hand-registered as a new name
  Purchased: 'purchased', // bought from someone (aftermarket, private)
  Sold: 'sold',
  Renewed: 'renewed', // renewals DomBot makes or sync sees (#107)
  Dropped: 'dropped', // you let it go; or the lookup found it gone (see below)
  Archived: 'archived', // no longer yours, reason unspecified
  // Something sync saw.
  Added: 'added', // the name appeared in an account
  Removed: 'removed', // the name is gone from an account
  Moved: 'moved', // gone from one of your accounts, appeared in another
} as const;
export type DomainEventType =
  (typeof DomainEventType)[keyof typeof DomainEventType];

export const DomainEventSource = {
  User: 'user',
  Sync: 'sync',
  Import: 'import',
  Lookup: 'lookup', // the registration check (the automatic drop only)
} as const;
export type DomainEventSource =
  (typeof DomainEventSource)[keyof typeof DomainEventSource];

interface DomainEvent {
  id: string; // time-sortable (ULID-style), also the storage key
  domain: string; // toAscii(name)
  type: DomainEventType;
  date: string | null; // YYYY-MM-DD, the day it happened; user-editable (null: a purchase or sale recorded without its day)
  createdAt: number; // ms epoch, when DomBot recorded it
  updatedAt: number | null; // ms epoch, last edit
  source: DomainEventSource;
  accountId?: string | null;
  fromAccountId?: string | null; // moved
  toAccountId?: string | null; // moved
  amount?: string | null; // canonical decimal, e.g. "19.99", "1500" (money.ts)
  currency?: CurrencyCode | null; // ISO 4217, from CURRENCIES
  years?: number | null; // registered, purchased, renewed: term length
  resolves?: string; // a user event closing a sync-detected one
  dismissed?: boolean; // sync alert acknowledged with no action
}
```

- **Repeats are normal.** Drop a name and buy it back: two `purchased`
  events. The cost basis shown in the table is the latest `purchased` or
  `registered` since the last `sold` or `dropped`.
- **No separate transfer type.** DomBot sees accounts, not registrar
  transfers, so a transfer always lands as one of the sync events: to another
  of your accounts (even at another registrar) is `moved`; to someone else is
  `removed`, resolved as `sold`; in from outside is `added`, resolved as
  `purchased`.
- **Timestamps follow the codebase.** Something DomBot records is `…At:
number` (ms epoch, like `createdAt`, `startedAt`, `fetchedAt`); a calendar
  day is a `YYYY-MM-DD` string (like `purchaseDate`), so it can't shift with
  the timezone. A sync event's `date` is the day of the sync; `createdAt` has
  the exact time.
- **Amounts are decimal strings,** as #99 stores them: digits and an optional
  period, with exactly the currency's decimal places (USD 2, JPY 0, KWD 3). A
  string is exact (no float rounding), reads as money in a data file, and
  exports to CSV unchanged, and the same text imports back. Code that needs to
  sum or compare parses it to integer minor units for the calculation.
- **Currencies are a fixed list.** `CURRENCIES` in `src/shared/currencies.ts`
  holds every active ISO 4217 code with its decimal places, and `CurrencyCode`
  is derived from it. A static list, not `Intl.supportedValuesOf`, so Electron,
  browsers, and the Worker all accept the same codes. Recently withdrawn codes
  (HRK, BGN, ANG, …) stay on it so a purchase recorded in one stays valid; the
  picker lists them last.
- **Notes point at events, not the other way round.** An event has no text;
  a `domain-notes` record can reference it (see below).
- **Amount and currency travel together.** Both set or both null, as #99
  already enforces.
- **`years` spreads a cost.** A 3-year renewal's amount covers three years, so
  a yearly view divides by `years` instead of charging it all to one year.
- **You vs. sync.** `added` and `removed` only say that a name appeared in or
  disappeared from an account; they don't say why. The user events say what
  happened (`purchased`, `sold`, `dropped`), usually resolving a sync one.
- **Sync writes, you resolve.** A sync that no longer sees a name writes
  `removed` (`source: 'sync'`) and raises an alert. Marking it Sold writes
  `sold` with `resolves: <removed id>`; Dropped writes `dropped` the same
  way; Dismiss sets `dismissed` on the `removed` event and records nothing
  else. #100's baselining (the first sync of an account creates no alerts)
  carries over as a `trackedSince` timestamp on the account's
  `registrar-accounts` record, also shown as "Tracking changes since" on the
  Activity page.
- **The baseline travels with the history.** The marker, the list sync diffs
  against, and `domain-events` must move together, so all three live in
  exported namespaces, never `meta` (which is `local`). The list is
  `registrar-last-sync` (each account's names as its last successful sync saw
  them), not the `registrar-domains` cache, so Clear cache can't make sync
  miss a change. After an import or a remote Pull, the next sync continues the
  imported history instead of re-baselining (missing real changes) or diffing
  against a list that doesn't match the imported events (inventing `added`
  and `removed`).
- **CSV import is idempotent.** A purchase row that matches an existing event
  on (domain, type, `date`, amount, currency) is skipped, so importing the same
  file twice doesn't double-count.
- **Merge-ready.** Ids are unique across instances, so a later remote sync can
  union `domain-events` by id instead of overwriting it.

## Owned, Archive, and Hidden

The Domains page switches between **Owned** and **Archive**. Archive is a list
of domains you no longer own, not a timeline; the timeline is the Activity page
(below).

Two separate questions, which the old Hidden → Archive folder had merged:

- **Do you still own it?** Owned or Archive, from events.
- **Do you want to see it?** The built-in Hidden folder.

### Owned and Archive

A name is in **Archive** once its latest ownership event is `sold`,
`dropped`, `archived`, or an unresolved `removed`; `added` brings it back.
Everything else is **Owned**. Purchases, registrations, and moves between
your accounts aren't ownership events, so recording what you paid for a sold
name leaves it in Archive. Archive is derived from events, never from a
folder.

- **Three manual actions: Sold, Dropped, Archived.** Each moves the name to
  Archive at once, whatever its registration status (a sale in progress, a
  name you've decided not to renew that is still in your account). Sold also
  records the price. Archived is the same as Dropped without saying why.
  "Move back to Owned" deletes that event (user events are editable).
- **A sync that no longer sees a name** writes `removed`, which also moves the
  name to Archive, shown as "Removed from registrar" until you label it (Sold,
  Dropped, Archived) or dismiss the alert. It never marks the name Dropped,
  so someone who manages names elsewhere and doesn't sync for months comes
  back to unlabeled names, never to wrong labels.
- **The one automatic label.** The registration check (`rdap-lookups`) writes
  `dropped` with `source: 'lookup'` only when both hold:
  1. RDAP gives a definite "not registered": a 404 from the registry's own RDAP
     server. A network error, timeout, any other status, or a 404 from the
     `rdap.org` redirector itself (which may mean it has no server for that
     TLD) counts as unknown and changes nothing.
  2. Today is past the name's last expiry date as DomBot knew it (from the
     registrar data before the name left).

  A real registration can't be missing before it expires, so a faulty lookup
  can't drop a name you still hold.

- **No derived "transferred" label.** RDAP only shows the registrar; an expired
  name sold or auctioned at the same registrar never changes registrar, and
  the registrant is redacted under GDPR (and registrar-scoped where present),
  so ownership can't be read from it.
- **All RDAP goes through one module.** Every registration lookup in the app
  uses a single central RDAP client, so bootstrap, caching, rate limits, and
  the "definite not registered" rule live in one place.

### Delete

**Delete** removes everything DomBot holds about a name: its events, notes,
folder, price override, and manual-domain entry. It's for mistakes and names
you never want to see again, not for recording what happened (that's Sold,
Dropped, or Archived). If a connected registrar still reports the name, the
next sync brings it back as a fresh name with no history.

### Hidden

**Hidden** is a built-in folder, like Archive was before it became an
ownership action. It's for names you still own but don't want in the default
list: personal names, or expiring ones you're letting go and don't want to
mark. A name is in one folder at most, so hiding it moves it out of its
current folder into Hidden. Hidden names are left out of Owned by default and
come back with the folder filter; they still sync and still raise alerts.

## Activity and alerts

### Activity page

A top-level **Activity** page (beside Domains and Renewals) lists every domain
event in one table, newest first: date, domain, what happened, account(s),
amount, source (you, sync, import, lookup), and status. It filters by event
type, domain, account, date range, and "Needs review", and reuses the Domains
table's sorting, paging, and sticky header. A domain's row menu gets "Activity",
which opens the same table filtered to that name.

- **One row per event.** A resolved alert keeps its outcome ("Sold", "Came
  back", "Dismissed") with Undo, so a misclick is visible and fixable; the
  resolving event is its own row too. Nothing disappears.
- **Review actions inline.** `removed`: Sold, Dropped, Archived, Dismiss.
  `added`: Record purchase (the dialog offers the registration fee), Dismiss.
  Both need review, but an arrival only asks what you paid, so it's the
  lowest-priority alert (dismiss or ignore one you don't care about). `moved`
  is info only.
- **Your own actions are rows too** (purchases, sales, imports), so Activity is
  the ledger the financial dashboard will build on.
- **Existing portfolios start empty.** An account's first sync only records a
  starting point, so Activity says "Tracking changes since <date>" instead of
  inventing past `added` events.

### The bell

The header bell always opens a dropdown, and never goes away (it shows at zero
too). It groups items by severity:

- **Error:** registrar sync failures, expired or rejected credentials.
- **Needs review:** unresolved `removed` events, with their actions.
- **Added:** unresolved `added` events, with their actions. The
  lowest-priority alert: listed after departures, and never enough on their
  own to color the badge.
- **Info:** `moved` events and other recent results.

Its badge counts errors plus review items and takes the color of the most
severe one: red for errors, amber for departures, gray when only new names
are waiting. "View all activity" opens the Activity page. This replaces #100's
Portfolio changes popover.

## Manual domains and notes

`manual-domains` (#108, after this release) will hold names you own that no
connected registrar reports — typed in, or imported from a CSV:

```ts
interface ManualDomain {
  registrar: RegistrarName | null; // a registrar DomBot knows, or null
  registrarLabel?: string | null; // free text otherwise, e.g. "Epik"
  expirationDate?: string | null; // YYYY-MM-DD
  createdDate?: string | null; // YYYY-MM-DD, registration date
  autoRenew?: boolean | null;
  addedAt: number; // ms epoch
  updatedAt: number | null; // ms epoch
}
```

They join the Domains table beside the registrar list and take folders,
prices, notes, and events like any other name. Clear cache never touches them.
Adding one writes `added` (`source: 'user'`, or `'import'` from a CSV) with no
account. If a connected registrar later reports the same name, sync removes
the `manual-domains` entry, the registrar's row takes over, and the diff
records a `moved` from no account. Notes, events, folders, and prices are
keyed by name, not by the manual entry, so they carry straight across; the
name never leaves the table, it only changes source.

`domain-notes` holds note records, keyed by note id, for any domain:

```ts
interface DomainNote {
  id: string; // storage key
  domain: string; // toAscii(name)
  eventId: string | null; // null: about the name; set: about that event
  text: string;
  createdAt: number; // ms epoch
  updatedAt: number | null; // ms epoch
}
```

The name's general note is the one with `eventId: null`, which replaces the
notes field #99 put on the purchase record. A sale or purchase can carry its
own note ("via Afternic, paid through Escrow.com") by pointing at its event.
The link lives on the note, so events stay small, an event can have several
notes, and deleting an event deletes its notes.

Notes stay their own namespace rather than fields on a catch-all per-name
record: each `domain-*` namespace holds one thing, so a future remote-sync
merge can't collide two unrelated edits to the same name. A new per-name field
(tags, an asking price) gets its own small namespace.

## Migration

A schema version lives in `meta` (`schemaVersion`).
`runMigrations(raw, store)` (`src/core/storage/migrations.ts`) runs before
`hydrateStores()` on both hosts: in `initStorage` on desktop, and in the
Worker's per-isolate boot, which every request awaits.

**Migration 1:**

1. Split `folders`: the `folders` key stays, the `assignments` map becomes one
   `domain-folders` entry per name (the legacy `__hidden__` Archive id is
   normalized on the way).
2. For each renamed namespace: `list(old)` → `putMany(new, …)` →
   `clear(old)`. Skipped when `old` is empty, so a rerun is harmless.
   `pricing-overrides` is re-keyed from `${accountId ?? registrar}:${name}`
   to `toAscii(name)` on the way.
3. Set `schemaVersion = 1`.

Re-keying by name can collide when two accounts held the same name with
different values. The first entry found wins and the rest are logged. (It only
happens for a name held by two accounts at once, i.e. mid-transfer.)

`raw` is the store **beneath** `EncryptedDocStore`, so renames copy values
exactly as stored: sealed values move as ciphertext, and a value the cipher
can't open right now (a locked desktop keyring) is moved rather than dropped.
The sealed-namespace set switches to the new names in the same release. The
folder map is the one value that has to be read; it goes through the
configured `store`, and if it exists but can't be opened the migration stops
before changing anything and retries on the next start.

The copies use `putMany`, so a large portfolio stays within the Worker
subrequest limit. Two Worker isolates booting at once can both run it;
copy-then-clear makes that safe, and the only exposure is a write landing in
a new namespace in the moment another isolate is still copying into it, which
is limited to the first requests after deploying this release.

**Migration 2** (ships with the domain history work):

1. Every `domain-folders` entry pointing at `__archive__` is repointed at the
   Hidden folder (`__hidden__`). Archive began as Hidden, and that's what
   these assignments mean: names you still own and don't want to see. Archive
   leaves the folder model and becomes an ownership action.
2. Set `schemaVersion = 2`. A v4 bundle from before this release gets the same
   step on import.

## Data bundle versions

**Rule:** any release that adds a namespace that isn't a cache bumps
`BUNDLE_VERSION`. An older build skips namespaces it doesn't know, so without
the bump it would import a newer file "successfully" and silently drop that
data; with remote sync (#89), pushing to a not-yet-upgraded instance and
pulling back would then lose it locally too. The bump makes the older build
refuse the file with "made by a newer DomBot".

- **v6** (planned, #108) adds `manual-domains`.
- **v5** adds the domain history (`domain-events`, `domain-notes`,
  `registrar-last-sync`). A v4 file imports into v5 unchanged; it just has no
  history.
- **v4** renamed the namespaces. `parseBundle` accepts v1–v3 by mapping old
  names to new ones and re-keying folders and prices, the same way the
  migration does, so every existing backup still imports.

Namespaces flagged `local` are never exported and never replaced by an
import; today that's `meta`, and `remote-sync` (#89) will join it. (`auth`
was on the old never-exported list but no namespace by that name exists; an
unknown namespace in a file is skipped anyway.)

## Rollout

1. **Storage conventions PR:** `domain-name.ts` and `DocStore.putMany`
   (moved over from the #99 branch, where they were written), namespace
   flags, renames, name-keyed folders and prices, `runMigrations`, bundle v4.
   Independent of #99 and #100.
2. **Domain history PR:** #99 and #100 combined and reworked onto
   `domain-events` and `domain-notes`, on top of step 1.
   Neither has shipped, so their data needs no migration. Bundle
   re-validation from the #99 branch carries over to `domain-events`.

## Decided

- **Event ids carry their date.** A time-sortable id (ULID-style: a
  millisecond timestamp prefix plus randomness), so ids sort by when the event
  was recorded and stay unique across instances.

## Future work

- **Every domain change writes an event.** Review each place that changes a
  domain — registrar sync, bulk edits, nameserver and auto-renew changes, MCP
  tool writes (#111), renewals DomBot makes or sync sees (#107) — and have it
  append to `domain-events`. The first domain-history PR only needs purchases,
  sales, and the sync-detected arrivals, departures, and moves.
- **Bulk review (#108).** The Activity page gets bulk tools (Dismiss, Record
  purchase, Dropped, Archived across many rows) for large imports and long
  gaps between syncs.
- **Venues (#109).** `registered`, `purchased`, and `sold` get a `venueId`.
  The list is every registrar DomBot supports, then built-in marketplaces
  (Afternic, Sedo, …), then custom venues. Each venue holds dated commission
  rates, so fees are derived rather than entered per sale, and a rate change
  never rewrites a past one.
- **Installments (#110).** A sale paid in installments stays one `sold` event;
  individual payments aren't recorded. The event gains the terms (number of
  payments, frequency, down payment) and, if the plan ends early, whether it
  was paid off or defaulted, so the dashboard can show the schedule.
- **Exchange rates.** Totals across currencies need a rate per event. Each
  event already has its `date` and `currency`, so historical rates can be
  looked up later without changing stored events.
- **Manual domains (#108)**, with a CSV importer. The purchase CSV import
  (#99, reworked in #100) is held back in #122 for its own review.
- **Financial dashboard (#112)**, built on all of the above.
