# Demo site

A public, browsable DomBot with an invented portfolio: real registrar names
and real renewal prices, fake domains, fake credentials, and nothing that
ever leaves the visitor's browser. Every part of the UI works — sync, detail
panels, bulk updates, renewals, folders, export — against an in-memory
registrar that accepts every write and never talks to anyone.

## How it works

`src/core` is host-agnostic, so the whole app (renderer + core) can run
inside one static page with no server. The demo swaps exactly one seam: the
provider behind `getRegistrarClient()`.

- **`src/core/demo/registrar.ts`** — `DemoRegistrar`, a `Registrar` served
  from a `DemoWorld` of records. It advertises the _real_ provider's feature
  list for its registrar name, so the UI gates ops exactly as it does for
  real accounts (Cloudflare still can't change nameservers, NameBright still
  has no DNSSEC). Writes mutate the world and report success; an op the real
  provider lacks throws the library's `NotImplementedError`. Pricing comes
  from the bundled base table, so it's true.
- **`src/core/demo/seed.ts`** — a deterministic generator (seeded PRNG) for
  524 single-dictionary-word domains (at most two share a name on a second
  TLD) across GoDaddy, Porkbun, Cloudflare, Dynadot,
  Namecheap and Spaceship, with realistic expiry spread (a few overdue, some
  due soon, a few multi-year), auto-renew/lock/privacy mixes, varied
  delegation (registrar default, Cloudflare, a few custom), contacts, DNS
  records, DNSSEC on a handful, four folders, and a few manual prices.
  Gandi, NameSilo, NameBright and Name.com are left unconfigured so the
  settings page shows both states.
- **`src/core/demo/index.ts`** — `installDemo()`: installs the factory
  (`configureRegistrarFactory` in `services/registrars.ts`), seeds fake
  credentials for the configured accounts (so they show as connected and the
  form pre-fills), creates the folders and manual prices. The host then runs a
  sync and the portfolio cache fills exactly as on a real first launch.

## Phases

1. ✅ Fake registrar + seed generator + factory hook, with tests.
2. ✅ `src/renderer/api/demo.ts` — a third `DombotApi` implementation that
   calls the core's method table in-process over a `MemoryDocStore` with
   bulk auto-drive on, and feeds core events straight to the `onX`
   subscriptions. `vite.demo.config.mts` builds it to `dist/demo`
   (`npm run demo:build`; `npm run demo:dev` for a dev server on 5199). The
   `__DOMBOT_DEMO__` define keeps the demo out of the desktop and web
   bundles.
3. ✅ Demo mode (`isDemo()` in `src/renderer/lib/platform.ts`): a strip
   across the top ("Demo Mode. Fake domains and credentials, nothing leaves
   browser.") with a Reset button
   (reload → fresh seed);
   the footer reads "Demo mode". Every page keeps its normal copy; only the
   controls that would change something real are disabled: saving or
   adding registrar credentials, the MCP switch, Import. Sync, export and
   CSV still work.
4. ✅ Published at **demo.dombot.ai** as a static-assets Worker
   (`wrangler.demo.jsonc`, `npm run demo:deploy`). The marketing site deploys
   the same way, as the `dombot-site` Worker on dombot.ai
   (`wrangler.site.jsonc`, `npm run site:deploy`).

   Both redeploy on every push to main through **Workers Builds**,
   Cloudflare's Git integration, configured per Worker in the dashboard. No
   API token and no GitHub secrets are involved, and because the connection
   lives in the upstream Cloudflare account rather than in the repo, a fork
   can't deploy either one. The Deploy button and `web:deploy` only ever
   read the root `wrangler.jsonc`.

   | Worker        | Build command        | Deploy command                               | Watch paths                                      |
   | ------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
   | `dombot-demo` | `npm run demo:build` | `npx wrangler deploy -c wrangler.demo.jsonc` | `src/*`, `data/*`, `package*.json`, `*demo*`     |
   | `dombot-site` | `npm run site:build` | `npx wrangler deploy -c wrangler.site.jsonc` | `site/*`, `scripts/inject-release.mjs`, `*site*` |

   Set the build variable `ELECTRON_SKIP_BINARY_DOWNLOAD=1` on both so the
   install step doesn't fetch Electron.

   Release links: the site bakes its download buttons from
   `site/release.json` at build time (a `transformIndexHtml` hook in
   `site/vite.config.ts`). The release workflow rewrites and commits that
   file right after publishing, and that push is what rebuilds the site.

   Page metadata: the shared `index.html` carries only what the desktop app
   needs, so `vite.demo.config.mts` injects the demo's `<head>` at build
   time (title, description, canonical, Open Graph / Twitter card, favicon)
   with the same copy as the marketing site. The favicon is
   `site/public/favicon.svg`, bundled as an asset; the sharing image is the
   site's `og-image.png`, referenced by its dombot.ai URL.

Linked from the site's nav and hero and from the README.

Open: whether visitor changes persist across reloads (`localStorage` mirror
plus Reset) and whether the desktop app gets a "try with sample data" mode,
which the same seed would provide.
