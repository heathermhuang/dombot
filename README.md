**All your domains, from every registrar, in one app + MCP.**

DomBot pulls your whole domain portfolio — scattered across GoDaddy, Dynadot,
Cloudflare, and more — into one desktop app, and serves the same portfolio to
your AI agents through a built-in MCP server. It's free, open source, and
local-first: your data and API keys stay on your machine.

**Download** for macOS, Windows, or Linux from
[**dombot.ai**](https://dombot.ai) or the
[Releases](https://github.com/aoxborrow/dombot/releases) page.

## What it does

- **One portfolio, every registrar.** Aggregates all your domains across the
  registrars you configure into a single sortable, filterable table — search by
  name, filter by TLD / registrar / nameserver, and see registrar, creation and
  expiry dates, auto-renew, transfer lock, WHOIS privacy, and nameservers side
  by side. Expiry dates are color-coded by urgency, and at-risk domains
  (expired, grace, redemption, hold) get a status badge.
- **Renewal costs at a glance.** A renewals dashboard forecasts your spend:
  yearly total, amount due in the next 90 days, a month-by-month renewal chart,
  and breakdowns by registrar and TLD. Prices come from registrar quotes where
  available and a base per-TLD price database otherwise, and you can enter a
  price by hand for anything still unpriced.
- **Export.** One click exports the current (filtered, sorted) view to a
  spreadsheet-friendly CSV.
- **Instant, offline-friendly launch.** The whole portfolio is cached on disk
  and painted the moment the app opens, with no network calls; you refresh on
  demand (it never auto-refreshes) and a timestamp flags when data is going
  stale.
- **Agent-ready.** An embedded local MCP server lets AI agents (Claude Code,
  Claude Desktop, any MCP client) read and manage the same portfolio — see
  [Connecting an AI agent](#connecting-an-ai-agent).

## Configuring registrars

DomBot currently supports **GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Dynadot, NameSilo, Spaceship,
Namecheap, Porkbun, Gandi, and NameBright**, with more on the way.

Add each registrar in **Settings → Registrars** with an API key from that
provider's account — DomBot shows where to find each one. Credentials are stored
encrypted on your device via your OS keychain (Electron `safeStorage`) and are
never sent anywhere but the registrar's own API. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
for the full trust model and how to verify it yourself.

After saving a registrar’s first account, use **Add another account** inside its
card to connect more. An account selector appears only for registrars with multiple
accounts; single-account registrars keep the original flow. See
[multiple registrar accounts](docs/multi-account.md) for migration and MCP selection.

## Connecting an AI agent

DomBot runs a local [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, bound to
your machine only, so any MCP client can work with your portfolio. To connect
Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add dombot --transport http http://127.0.0.1:4123/mcp
```

On first connect a browser page opens and DomBot's own window shows an
Approve/Deny prompt with a matching confirmation code. Approve once and the
client stays paired across restarts; manage or revoke paired clients in
**Settings → MCP Clients**. The URL and a ready-to-paste connect command are
also shown on the Home screen.

**Claude Desktop** (and other clients that can only launch a command) use the
app itself as a stdio server. Copy the ready-made entry from **Settings → MCP**
into `claude_desktop_config.json`; it looks like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dombot": {
      "command": "/Applications/DomBot.app/Contents/MacOS/DomBot",
      "args": ["--mcp-stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

No approval prompt is needed for this route — it runs as you, on your machine —
and if DomBot isn't open when the client starts, it launches automatically.

## Self-hosting in the browser

The same app runs as a private web app on your own Cloudflare account — a
Worker plus one D1 database, encrypted under a key only you hold, with the MCP
server reachable at `https://<your-host>/mcp`.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/aoxborrow/dombot)

The button forks the repo, creates the database, and asks for the two secrets
(the deploy page tells you how to generate them). Then open the URL and sign
in. Prefer the CLI, want to redeploy from GitHub Actions, or need to put it
behind Cloudflare Access? See [docs/self-hosting.md](docs/self-hosting.md).

Moving from the desktop app: **Settings → Sync → Export data**, then import
the file on your instance.

The web build also supports an optional **Public portfolio**: reconcile a curated
collection against connected accounts, edit privately, and publish selected
names at `/p/<handle>`. No inventory is public by default. See
[publishing and its privacy boundary](docs/public-portfolio.md).

# Development

DomBot is a cross-platform desktop app built with Electron Forge, React 19,
TypeScript (strict), and Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS v4 and Zustand for
state. Registrar API support comes from
[`@aoxborrow/registrar-client`](https://github.com/aoxborrow/registrar-client);
agents connect through an embedded MCP server. Contributions welcome — clone
the repo, `npm install`, and `npm start` to run the app with hot reload.

## Credentials

Registrar credentials are entered in **Settings → Registrars** and stored
encrypted via Electron `safeStorage` — in development and production alike. There
is **no `.env`/environment-variable fallback**: credentials come only from the
GUI store, so ambient vars from other tools can't silently shadow them (see
[`resolveField`](src/core/services/registrars.ts) and
[`src/core/services/credentials.ts`](src/core/services/credentials.ts)). The same
saved credentials feed both the UI and the MCP server. For the full trust model
and how to verify it, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Embedded MCP server

The MCP server (see [Connecting an AI agent](#connecting-an-ai-agent)) is a
third _adapter_ over the same `services/` core the UI uses — see
[`src/electron/mcp/`](src/electron/mcp).

- **Transport:** Streamable HTTP, bound to `127.0.0.1` only. Never exposed off
  the machine.
- **Auth:** OAuth 2.1 (dynamic client registration + PKCE), served by the app.
  The approval prompt lives in DomBot's own window; the issued token is
  persisted (`userData/mcp-tokens.json`) so clients stay paired across
  restarts. Env knobs: `DOMBOT_MCP_PORT` (default `4123`),
  `DOMBOT_MCP_ENABLED=0` to disable, `DOMBOT_MCP_AUTOAPPROVE=1` to skip the
  approval prompt (dev/testing), `DOMBOT_MCP_TOKEN` for a static bearer token
  escape hatch (dev/testing). See
  [`src/electron/mcp/oauth.ts`](src/electron/mcp/oauth.ts).
- **stdio shim.** `DomBot --mcp-stdio` runs the same binary headless as a
  stdin/stdout bridge to the HTTP server, for clients that can't dial a URL
  (Claude Desktop). It authenticates with a per-install token the app writes to
  `userData/mcp-stdio.json`, launches the app if it isn't running, and
  re-initializes its session transparently if the app restarts. stdout is the
  JSON-RPC channel, so all logging in that mode goes to stderr. See
  [`src/electron/mcp/stdio.ts`](src/electron/mcp/stdio.ts). Dev builds aren't
  auto-launched — start the app first.
- **Tools.** Named by scope, so a caller can tell at a glance what a tool acts
  on: `portfolio_*` take no scope params, `registrar_*` require a `registrar`
  id, and `domain_*` take a `domain`. For `domain_*` tools the `registrar` is
  optional — DomBot resolves it from the cached portfolio (you own the domain,
  so it knows who holds it), so an agent can act on a name without first looking
  up its registrar. Pass `registrar` to skip the lookup, or to act on a name not
  yet in the cache; if the cache can't resolve it, the tool says so and points
  at `portfolio_sync`.
  - _Portfolio:_ `registrar_list`, `portfolio_query`, and `portfolio_sync`.
    `portfolio_query` is the primary way to read the portfolio: list, search,
    filter, sort, and page the cached portfolio (by registrar, TLD, folder,
    name, nameserver, auto-renew/lock/privacy, status, and expiry), returning
    only the fields an agent needs plus sync health (`total`, `stale`, and
    per-registrar `errors`). With no filters it returns everything (paged), so
    it doubles as a plain list. It's a pure cache read (no registrar calls);
    `portfolio_sync` runs the live cross-registrar pass that refreshes the
    cache, returning a per-registrar summary. An agent syncs once (or when
    `portfolio_query` reports `stale`/empty), then reads cheaply.
  - _Registrar reads:_ `registrar_test`, `registrar_domains`, `registrar_sync`
    (targeted single-registrar refresh of the cache),
    `registrar_check_availability`, `registrar_pricing`.
  - _Domain reads:_ `domain_get`, `domain_contacts_get`,
    `domain_nameservers_get`, `domain_dns_get`, `domain_email_forwarding_get`,
    `domain_url_forwarding_get`, `domain_renewal_price` (DomBot's own estimate,
    distinct from `registrar_pricing`). `domain_get` and
    `domain_nameservers_get` serve from the detail cache when fresh, fetch live
    and write through otherwise, and take `refresh` to force a live fetch.
  - _Writes (non-money):_ `domain_nameservers_set`, `domain_dns_set`,
    `domain_contacts_set`, `domain_email_forwarding_set`,
    `domain_url_forwarding_set`, `domain_set_autorenew`, `domain_set_lock`,
    `domain_set_privacy`. Forwarding (email alias and URL redirect) is
    per-registrar — unsupported providers return an error.
  - _Writes (money):_ `registrar_register_domain`, `registrar_transfer_domain`,
    `domain_renew`. Not gated behind extra per-call approval — the
    connection-level OAuth approval is the gate — and annotated non-idempotent.
  - _Cache write-through._ A successful write patches the local cache (the same
    cache the desktop UI reads) and pushes an update to any open window, so the
    Domains table reflects the change live — no manual Sync needed.
  - _Cache freshness._ Reads serve the local cache and report `stale` /
    `fetchedAt`; an agent refreshes explicitly with `portfolio_sync` /
    `registrar_sync`. The app also runs a periodic background sync so the cache
    stays warm for MCP-only use (no window ever opened). The interval is set in
    **Settings → Sync** (Every hour … 7 days, or Off; default 24h, applied
    live); large portfolios may prefer a longer interval or Off.
    `DOMBOT_SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES` overrides the setting for dev/testing (`0`
    disables).
- **Credentials.** Resolved the same way as the UI (see
  [Credentials](#credentials)); a registrar is "configured" when all of its
  required fields are present.
